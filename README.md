Hello, my name is Ranen Hicks and this is my ePortfolio that (currently) contains courswork from my Computer Science Capstone at SNHU.

## Professional Self-Assesment:
Enhancing my code from previous coursework gave me a good look into how far I have come as a coder. Even now, I am still striving to improve myself, reducing things like magic numbers to help the readability and understanding of the code in general. It also shows some of my strengths, like flexibility to change, problem solving, and ability to code in multiple languages to list a few which have only been strengthened throughout working towards my Computer Science degree.  

While I was in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I did not do much in a team environment, but I still do have some experience coding in a group at another school. At my previous college, Clark College, I made a program with another person and was able to present it in front of the class with my teammate. This gave me some experience in my presentation skills in terms of coding, as I learned how to navigate through presenting code to an audience. Not to mention, at SNHU, I still learned a lot about how programs are made within an SDLC. 

Previous courses like CS-250 taught me about the Software Development Life Cycle, and the different parts of the development phase. I personally like the agile method the best, as it is the one that I understand the most and seems to be very team oriented with things like the Daily Scrum meetings (Hicks, 2023). This allowed me to get a small glimpse of what it would be like to program within the professional world while working in a team. This course also taught me a little bit about how to talk with stakeholders by putting myself in the product owner position. Doing this allowed me to research how a product owner worked, how they talk with stakeholders, and the skills that might be needed to complete this task (Hicks, 2023).  

Going back to this course, CS-499, I enhanced three artifacts, Project One CS-320 Artifact – Ranen Hicks, IT-145 Project Two, and CS-340 ProjectTwo Artifact – Ranen Hicks for these three categories, Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases respectively.  Enhancing the Software Design and Engineering artifact helps me retain, regain and increase my skill with python. It also, by rewriting the code in python from java, allowed me to showcase my skills in coding in multiple languages, as I was able to understand the previous code and create new code in a new language accordingly.  Enhancing the Algorithms and Data Structures artifact allowed me to learn and review my knowledge and skills on data structures, understanding when some data structures are better than others. Enhancing the Databases artifact was the most difficult for me, which means that it was the best to showcase my skills and strengths. To even complete this project, I had to be flexible as I found myself almost having to switch from normal web development with typescript and express to Django which I had no prior experience with. This means that I had to problems solve a lot, figuring out ways to connect databases together to complete the enhancement that I wanted to. 

These artifacts, enhancements, code review, narratives, and ePortfolio give a lot of insight into who I am as a coder. The code review is a video that helps show how I look at and understand code and shows how much I have improved over the years. The narratives follow along their respective artifact enhancement and give a deeper look into how I tackle problems that may not be part of the finished product. The artifacts and enhancements show my improvement as a coder, how I solve problems in code, and my understanding of multiple programming languages. In fact, I have worked with more coding languages than python and java, C being one example of this. The ePortfolio brings all of this together, allowing me to link and show my coursework on a webpage that is easy for others to navigate. It also helped me show a little of my UI skills, creating navigating links to sections of the page which would be helpful to a user especially when a webpage is long. 

Thank you all for your time, 

Ranen Hicks
